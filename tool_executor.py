"""
Tool implementations for the Logistics Route Planner.

This is a DEMO implementation that generates fake data!
In a real system, this would connect to real APIs and databases.
Instead, we generate random but realistic-looking data to show how it would work.

Each tool method follows this pattern:
1. Take input parameters
2. Generate realistic-looking fake data
3. Return a response that matches what a real API might return
